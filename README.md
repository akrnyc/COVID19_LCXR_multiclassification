In-line Image Transformations on Lung Chest X-Rays for Multiclass Classification

The following is a computer vision study using lung chest x-ray data to assess the impact of multiclass classification based on imbalanced transformed image datasets. Data were transformed to 1. correct for class imbalance and 2. enhance edge features.

**DISCLAIMER:** This study does not make any clinical observations or recommendations for any diseases, especially those mentioned in the study related to lung disease pathology. Research conducted is for artificial intelligence computer vision and makes no claims in regards to medicine, biology, health, or any related discipline of the aforementioned.
